# Environments

Environments are their own universe. They contain all of the current schemas for your domains. They also keep a log of all commands issued to the environment, and a log of as all resulting events from those commands.

They are where schemas for domains are created, imported, reshaped, and tested. They may be a particular release of your application. They may be a clone of an existing environment when developing, testing and staging new releases. Or, they may just be a sandbox for playing around with a set of domain schemas when in development.
